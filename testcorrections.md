# Test Corrections

Here are the test corrections:

# Week 1

**Q3** - This was just a monkey moment because I didn't see that the new object was just creating a new object for B. I included A too because I saw that the new object was going to be called A. Since the object is just creating a new object for B, we just display B. .

**Q4** - This was an array question (the one thing that I suck at). I have no idea how this works so I need to work on the arrays on my book and learn that. 

**Q8** - Also an array question. This is a double array too, so I have no idea how it works. Need to learn how to do arrays in the book. 

**Q10** - I just didn't understand how to do approach this question because it seemed kind of weird. I think I need to review over the extends because that is the thing that is most confusing. Pretty simple though. 

**Q13** - Another array! Can't do arrays. Need to review it in the AP CSA book. 

**Q31** - ANOTHER ARRAY?!?!?!? Need to review in the CSA book. 

**Q33** - Array again. Need to review in the CSA book.
