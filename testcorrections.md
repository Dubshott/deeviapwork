Explanation: The reason that this is the right answer is because you can't have two constructors with the same exact definitions. If we did, then the computer wouldn't know which constructor to run, which would cause a compilation error. Therefore, E is the right answer because it is exactly the same as the original constructor. 

# Week 1

**Q3** - This was just a monkey moment because I didn't see that the new object was just creating a new object for B. I included A too because I saw that the new object was going to be called A. Since the object is just creating a new object for B, we just display B. .

**Q4** - This was an array question (the one thing that I suck at). I have no idea how this works so I need to work on the arrays on my book and learn that. 

**Q8** - Also an array question. This is a double array too, so I have no idea how it works. Need to learn how to do arrays in the book. 

**Q10** - I just didn't understand how to do approach this question because it seemed kind of weird. I think I need to review over the extends because that is the thing that is most confusing. Pretty simple though. 

**Q13** - Another array! Can't do arrays. Need to review it in the AP CSA book. 

**Q31** - ANOTHER ARRAY?!?!?!? Need to review in the CSA book. 

**Q33** - Array again. Need to review in the CSA book.
