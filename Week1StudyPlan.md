# Week 1 Study Plan (4/18 - 4/22)

## Monday

The plan for monday is to just work on this ticket and start working through the Princeton AP exam book. I think I need to prepare a lot more for this test since I am not as prepared as the CSP exam. 

The main things that I need to work on are probably just working with the FRQs. I think this would be the most beneficial at the moment because I could just come up with answers for the MCQ, since most of it just basic coding logic. 

Most of the things I need to learn is just how to format all the code and practice A TON of diferent frqs so that I can get used to it all and work through the regular test. 

## Tuesday

I want to spend like an hour at school practicing some of the MCQs so that I can get used the format and learn how the test is going to go. It will also give me a good understanding of how good I am at the MCQ. If I really suck at it, then I can spend more time working on that as well. 

I want to start working on the MCQ prortion of the test on the princeton book so that I can start to learn some of the concepts that they ask. Since most of it is just normal code, I can try to look for the patterns. 

## Wednesday

Now I want to prep for the FRQ on thursday since I don't want to take a fat L. I'll first complete the test corrections for the MCQ, but then I want to look over multiple frqs to see the format of everything and work through the different problems. I want to try and test the levels of the tests and see how difficult it is for me. 

At home, I want to spend more time on the frq section in the princeton review book so that I can learn how to actually approach the frqs and how to work through them all. I'm assuming that it all follows the same content from the mcq, so I would just need to practice it multiple times so I understand how to write the programs for the FRQ.  

## Thursday

Now during school, we are going to be taking the FRQ, so I will probably be working through that for the entire period. This will also help me get a good understanding of how well I do in the test, so I will know what I need to do to make sure the frqs go better. 

Based on my understanding of the MC and FRQ, I will work on the section that I am struggling with the most and focus on that sesction on the Princeton review guide.  

## Friday

I will be working on the test corrections for the FRQs with other people so that we can peer grade and see how well I did. I think this will be more of a break day, so I will try to take it a little lighter and just focus on the test corrections and what I could do to make it better.
